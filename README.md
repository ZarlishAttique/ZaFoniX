Introduction
ZaFoniX is a clinical research tool designed for identifying drug therapies based on genetic information, disease names, or specific drug identifiers. Developed by Zarlish Attique, it supports precision medicine efforts by integrating therapeutic recommendations with drug approval statuses and development stages. ZaFoniX offers a secured login system, flexible search options, and clear data visualization, making it an effective solution for clinicians, researchers, and healthcare data analysts.

Installation Requirements
To use ZaFoniX, ensure that your computer has Python version 3.7 or higher installed. Standard Python packages for data handling and visualization, including pandas, matplotlib, and Pillow, must be available. Tkinter, the GUI framework used, comes pre-installed with Python in most systems. If needed, install any missing packages before proceeding.

Download the complete ZaFoniX folder. Place all files in the same directory without altering the folder structure.

Launching the Application
Open your systemâ€™s command prompt or terminal. Navigate to the ZaFoniX folder. Run the application by executing the main file. Upon starting, ZaFoniX will request an access key. Enter your authorized access key to proceed to the main dashboard.

Using ZaFoniX
Once logged in, the main window will appear with a search interface. Three search options are available: by disease name, drug name, or gene ID.

Type your search query into the input field and select the appropriate search button. You can further filter your results to view only FDA-approved drugs, experimental drugs, or investigational drugs.

The results will be displayed in an interactive table. Users can scroll horizontally or vertically to explore the information fully. ZaFoniX also provides an option to export search results into CSV or Excel files for further analysis.

Additionally, a separate visualization panel allows users to view the distribution of drug types and target actions through dynamically generated charts.

Troubleshooting
If the application does not start, verify that Python is properly installed and that all required libraries are available. Ensure that "DrugsList.xlsx" is present in the correct folder. If access is denied during login, confirm that you are using the correct access key provided during registration or setup.
